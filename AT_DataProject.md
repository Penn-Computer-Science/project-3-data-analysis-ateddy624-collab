## Data Analysis & Insights
Write a short analysis of your findings. Include at least one interesting insight from your data.

> I found that students who exercise for more than 3 hours per week reported having a higher GPA than those who didn't. Hours spent exercising generally peaked amongst people with a GPA of 3.4 or higher.

## Reflection
Answer briefly:
- One thing that went well during this project includes my ability to easily collect data and turn it into graphs
- The most dificult part of this project was keeping myself from overcomplicating my code and simply letting the additional libraries do their jobs.
- I would have obtained more factual data so that I could present a more accurate representation of reality.
